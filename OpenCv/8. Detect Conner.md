# Detect Conner in Pattern Image

Now we need to use the header file(download in No.6)
```
#include "opencv2\core.hpp"
#include "opencv2\highgui.hpp"
#include "opencv2\imgcodecs.hpp"
#include "opencv2\imgproc.hpp"
#include "opencv2\calib3d.hpp"
#include "opencv2\aruco.hpp"
```

### findChessboardCorners

One function called `findChessboardCorners(Matrix input, Size inputBoardDimension, Vector2D connerLocation, int Flag)`

it take a image and the conner size of image as input

it would found a 2D vector of conner location

it proccess speed and accuracy depends on flag
