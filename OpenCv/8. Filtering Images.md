 # Change Brightness of Image or Video
 
 Changing brightness is a point operation on each pixel. 
 
 If you want to increase the brightness, you have to add some constant value to each and every pixel.
                         
                         `new_img (i, j) = img(i, j) + c`

 If you want to decrease the brightness, you have to subtract some constant value from each and every pixel.
                         
                         `new_img (i, j) = img(i, j) - c`
### Example
```
 Mat imgL = img + Scalar(-75, -75, -75); //decrease the brightness by 75 units for 3 channels
```
