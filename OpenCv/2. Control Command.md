# Basic Control Command

all function and class are under the `cv namespace`

`Mat varible = imread("fileName", flag);` --- allow opencv to read image under the project folder and store in varible

  ### Flag
  - `CV_LOAD_IMAGE_UNCHANGED` - image-depth=8 bits per pixel in each channel,  no. of channels=unchanged 
  
  - `CV_LOAD_IMAGE_GRAYSCALE` - image depth=8 bits,  no. of channels=1
  
  - `CV_LOAD_IMAGE_COLOR` - image-depth=?,  no. of channels=3
  
  - `CV_LOAD_IMAGE_ANYDEPTH` - image-depth=unchanged ,  no. of channels=?
  
  - `CV_LOAD_IMAGE_ANYCOLOR` - image-depth=?,  no. of channels=unchanged 

  - The `image-depth` means the number of bits allocated for each pixel. If it is 8, each pixel can have a value between 0 and 255. If it is 4, each pixel can have a value between 0 to 15 (1111 in binary).

`bool Mat::empty()`

This function returns true, if `Mat::data==NULL` or `Mat::total() == 0`

---

`nameWindow("windowName", flag);` --- allow opencv to create a empty window 

  - `CV_WINDOW_AUTOSIZE` - User cannot resize the image. Image will be displayed in its original size
  - `CV_WINDOW_FREERATIO` - User can resize the image. Image will be displayed in its original size

`resizeWindow("windowName", long, width);` --- allow the opencv to resize the window with given long*width;

`moveWindow("windowName", long, width);` --- allow the opencv to move the existing window to the give place

---

`imshow("name", variable(matrix));` --- allow the window to show the image

`imwrite("outputfilename", variable);` --- allow opencv to output a image

---

`waitKey();` --- wait user to press the key then continue

waitKey() function wait for keypress for certain time, specified by delay (in milliseconds). If delay is zero or negative, it will wait for infinite time. If any key is pressed, this function returns the ASCII value of the key and your program will continue. If there is no key press for the specified time, it will return -1 and program will continue.
