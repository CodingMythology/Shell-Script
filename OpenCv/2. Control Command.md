# Basic Control Command

all function and class are under the `cv namespace`

`Mat varible = imread("fileName", flag);` --- allow opencv to read image under the project folder and store in varible

  ### Flag
  - `CV_LOAD_IMAGE_UNCHANGED` - image-depth=8 bits per pixel in each channel,  no. of channels=unchanged 
  
  - `CV_LOAD_IMAGE_GRAYSCALE` - image depth=8 bits,  no. of channels=1
  
  - `CV_LOAD_IMAGE_COLOR` - image-depth=?,  no. of channels=3
  
  - `CV_LOAD_IMAGE_ANYDEPTH` - image-depth=unchanged ,  no. of channels=?
  
  - `CV_LOAD_IMAGE_ANYCOLOR` - image-depth=?,  no. of channels=unchanged 

  - The `image-depth` means the number of bits allocated for each pixel. If it is 8, each pixel can have a value between 0 and 255. If it is 4, each pixel can have a value between 0 to 15 (1111 in binary).

`imshow("name", variable(matrix));` --- allow the window to show the image

`imwrite("outputfilename", variable);` --- allow opencv to output a image

`nameWindow("windowName", flag);` --- allow opencv to create a empty window 

`resizeWindow("windowName", long, width);` --- allow the opencv to resize the window with given long*width;

`moveWindow("windowName", long, width);` --- allow the opencv to move the existing window to the give place

`waitKey();` --- wait user to press the key then continue
