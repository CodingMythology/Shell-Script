# Case

like c++ case would match the `expression` to the `pattern`

```
case expression in
    pattern1 )
        statement ;;
    pattern2 )
        statement ;;
    * )
        statement ;;
esac
```

`expression` usually variable

`pattern` match with expression

`;;` 


`esac` <- inverse means end of case
