# File

We have multi-flag to check the file

`-e` check for exist

`-f` check whether it is a file

`-d` check for whether it is a directory

`-c` check for it is a character file like .txt or .doc

`-b` check for it is a block file like .avi .jpg

`-s` check for it is empty or not

`-w` check for whether we have write permission

# writing file

`cat` is the command allow user to write in the file(like ofsteam)

`>>` allow user to append the input at the end of file

`>` would over write the file with user input

Example
```
cat >> test;
cat > test;
```
