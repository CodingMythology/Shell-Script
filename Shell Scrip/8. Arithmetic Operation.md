# Arithmetic Operation

if we use `echo 1 + 1` we would seee it print ` 1 + 1`

how can we print `2` in echo?

```
$(( operation ))
echo "Addition = $(( number_1 + number_2 ))"
$( expr )
echo "Addition = $( expr number1 + number2)"
```

remember without `$` the echo would treat them as string

add `$` echo would treat them as variables

### Operation

`+` addition

`-` subtraction

`/` division

`*` multiplication  (note here: when using `expr` the multiplication needs escaped charecter  `\*`

`%` module
