# Integer Arithmetic Operation

if we use `echo 1 + 1` we would seee it print ` 1 + 1`

how can we print `2` in echo?

```
$(( operation ))
echo "Addition = $(( number_1 + number_2 ))"
$( expr )
echo "Addition = $( expr number1 + number2)"
```

remember without `$` the echo would treat them as string

add `$` echo would treat them as variables

### Operation

`+` addition

`-` subtraction

`/` division

`*` multiplication  (note here: when using `expr` the multiplication needs escaped charecter  `\*`

`%` module


# Foalt Operation

in linux there is a langage called `bc` basic commmand it can calculate the precision calculator(using `man bc` to check it)

using `bc` after command

`echo " 1.0 + 1.1" | bc` -> `2.1`

### :+1 
here for division `20.5/5` would get 4

we can use `scale = decimal number`

`scale = 5; 20.5/5` = `4.10000`
