# While

```
while [condition]
do 
    statement1
    statement2
    statement3
done
```
Example
```
n = 1;
while [ $n -le 10]
do 
    n = $(( n++))
done
```

# Until Loop
```
until [condition]
do 
    statement1
    statement2
    statement3
done
```

### Note here
if we use flag `-` we need `[]`

if we use sign `<` we use `(())`


# For Loop
for loop has two styles

### Style 1
```
for varible in 1 2 3 4 5 / {1..5..1} ({start..end..increment})
do  
    statement
done
```

### Style C++
```
for varible (( initial; condition; increament)) <- remeber use ((
do
    statement
done
```

### Trick Here

in shell script some key words like `ls`, `pwd` can treat as command 

initial `cmd = ls`

and `$cmd` can list all file

and it can use inside for loop
```
for cmd in ls pwd
do
    echo "------------------$cmd-------------------"
    $cmd
done
```

Also use `*` can search each file or directory in the folder

`for variable in * `
