# Pass argument

like agrv[] in c++

we can pass argument from terminal

`$0` is default for scrip name

and the following name is store in `$1` `$2`....

# Array

if you want use the array

`args = ("$@")` and args[0] is for first input variable

and if you `echo $@` all passed varible would be printed

# Total number in the args

`$#` store the number in the args
